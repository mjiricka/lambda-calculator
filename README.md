This is one of my school projects: lambda calculus evaluator. It was made for Functional Programming course. It helped me to grasp the topic better.


## How to build and run

Library `readline` and `g++` are needed for compilation.

This compiles the project:

    make

Then it can be started:

    ./lambdacalc


## Notes

 - Original parser generated by `bison++` is committed. I tried to regenerate it with a newer version (`1.21.9-1`), but it would require changes in code to make it work.
     - Command `make grammar` regenerates it. (See `Makefile` for details.)
